# Primordial Cosmology
Code for investigating primordial power spectra. 

This repository contains the files that were worked on as part of my Part III project on Primordial Cosmology. 

Two distinct analyses were performed. You can find the toy model [here](/playground/toy_models), while the cosmology codes can be found [here](/cosmology/job_directories/primordial_ps). In addition the python environment was setup using [this file](/environments/new_cobaya_install.sh).
